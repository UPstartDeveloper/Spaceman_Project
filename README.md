A word guessing game implemented using Python.

Based off the more morbidly named "Hangman" game.

Enter a letter you think is in the mystery word.
YOU CAN ONLY GUESS ONE LETTER AT A TIME.
You have seven tries to guess all the letters in the word!

If you win, congratulations! Don't worry though: if you lose, you
will treated to a *special* image of an astronaut to view! You can
also retry as many times as you like.
